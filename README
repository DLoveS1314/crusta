Crusta is an immersive virtual globe application.

Crusta enables:
1) representation of global, high-resolution surface data,
2) visualization of these data on a real-time virtual globe, and
3) efficient exploration and annotation using real-time interactive software tools.

Using Crusta one can easily import sub-meter resolution DEM or aerial imagery for any location on the globe. Dynamic manipulation of the visualization using local illumination, real-time scaling of vertical exaggeration, and hardware accelerated textured iso-lines support explorative discovery of key surface features that results in a clear understanding of their three-dimensional embedding. Key features such as fault scarps, landslides, and other historically preserved geologic markers can be directly mapped on the virtual landscape. Real-time mapping and the identification of features using a three-dimensional immersive application greatly improves the confidence and localization of mapped features.
