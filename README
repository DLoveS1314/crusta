====== Introduction ======

Crusta is an immersive virtual globe application.

Crusta enables:
1) representation of global, high-resolution surface data,
2) visualization of these data on a real-time virtual globe, and
3) efficient exploration and annotation using real-time
   interactive software tools.

Using Crusta one can easily import sub-meter resolution DEM or aerial imagery
for any location on the globe.  Dynamic manipulation of the visualization
using local illumination, real-time scaling of vertical exaggeration, and
hardware accelerated textured iso-lines support explorative discovery of key
surface features that results in a clear understanding of their three-
dimensional embedding.  Key features such as fault scarps, landslides,
and other historically preserved geologic markers can be directly mapped
on the virtual landscape.  Real-time mapping and the identification of
features using a three-dimensional immersive application greatly improves
the confidence and localization of mapped features.


====== Install ======

To install Crusta from source, you'll need the following:

  * git
  * cmake 2.8.0+
  * Vrui 2.7 w/ development files
  * GDAL 1.8+ w/ development files
  * GLU w/ development files
  * GLEW

To get going quickly, from the same directory as this file, just do:

  cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/for/crusta && make install

If you have any software in a non-standard place, you may need to set
the cmake variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or the environment variable
PKG_CONFIG_PATH.  E.g.

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/Vrui/pkgconfig cmake . \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/for/crusta && make install
